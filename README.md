## Scampi Benchmark - compare feature-extraction methods for microfossil images

As a joint project between [UiT](https://uit.no/startsida) and [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/energy/digitalisation) as part of the [SFI Visual Intelligence consortium](https://www.visual-intelligence.no/publications/the-3-billion-fossil-question-how-to-automate-classification-of-microfossils), our paper ["The 3-billion fossil question: How to automate classification of microfossils"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aiig.2024.100080) introduced the use of self-supervised learning for creating a DNN which excels at image feature extraction for images of microfossils. Further work in our upcoming publication "The Fossil Frontier: Answering the 3-billion fossil question" builds on this, using a data-curation step which increases the performance on the downstream tasks of CBIR and image classification.

### In this repository:

- Benchmarking data used in our publications:
  - 697 labelled images from 20 genera of dinoflagellate cycts and other palynomorphs from the well NO 6407/6-5 
  - These images are distributed under the [Norwegian Licence for Open Government Data (NLOD) 2.0](https://data.norge.no/nlod/en/2.0), as adaptations of palynology slide scans created by the [Norwegian Offshore Directorate](https://www.sodir.no/en/facts/geology/geobank/palyslides/palynology-slides-available-in-diskos/)

- Code for benchmarking the performance of our network (insert Huggingface link) against [dino-vits8](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dino-vits8) and [dino-vits16](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dino-vits16) from Meta is also provided.

### Acknowledgements
We are grateful to Equinor for permission to release the labelled data, and to [Martin Pearce](https://www.palaeo7.com/people/martin-pearce.html) for performing the labelling.
